# ExamplePresentation
An example of a data analysis presentation I created for the Spring 2023 SIS-750 Data Analysis course I took at American University.

This  was meant to be a simple demonstration of using RMarkdown to create slides. I had to go find my own data, conduct an analysis using that data, then finally present the results.

Data was from XYZ cited location. I cleaned the data using A, B, and C steps. The slides were created using RStudio and the 

Files for the project:
- 'mydata.csv` raw data
- `slides.Rmd` code that generates the slides
- `index.html` this is the output set of slides
