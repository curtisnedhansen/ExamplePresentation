# ExamplePresentation
An example of a data analysis presentation I created for the Spring 2023 SIS-750 Data Analysis course I took at American University.

This  was meant to be a simple demonstration of using RMarkdown to create slides. I had to go find my own data, conduct an analysis using that data, then finally present the results.

Data was from downloaded from [the Latinobarometro website](https://www.latinobarometro.org/latContents.jsp). To reduce the filesize I trimmed the dataset to only include my six variables of interest and to simplify the analysis I also dropped all records with missing or NULL values. The slides were created using RStudio and the `ioslides` package. 

Files for the project:
- `Latinobarometro_2020_Eng_Rdata_v1_0` raw data
- `slides.Rmd` code that generates the slides
- `index.html` this is the output set of slides

**See the slides** using `gh-pages` [at this link](https://curtisnedhansen.github.io/ExamplePresentation/).
